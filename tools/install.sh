#
#   Developer Mode  -> ares-install, the way the webOS CLI is meant to be used.
#   rooted (webosbrew, a password in the profile) -> ssh, one command per
#     connection.
#
# The second route exists because ares-install does not work against the sshd a
# rooted TV runs. That sshd is the dropbear the Homebrew Channel ships, and it
# refuses the exec channel ares-install opens right after the sftp upload
# ("ares-install ERR! Error: Unable to exec", reproducible on every attempt):
# the CLI keeps one connection and asks for several channels on it. So the ssh
# route makes a fresh connection per step instead — upload, install, clean up —
# and none of them needs a second channel.
#
# Run: make install (or make deploy)
