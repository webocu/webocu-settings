# Keepalive daemon for WebOCU Settings (and any app ID it was cloned to)
# Prevents the app from being closed by the system due to inactivity.
# This script runs in background and calls /keepalive endpoint every 30 seconds.
# It also starts the app once when it starts (see below); the app's Autostart
# switch decides whether that start opens the panel or ends the app.
#
# Written to the TV by the helper service, which keeps a copy of this file outside
# the app's folder, in the app's own data folder (one per app ID, the same layout
# WebOCU Dock uses):
#   /media/developer/apps/var/lib/webocu/<app-id>/keepalive_daemon.sh
# and links it into the Homebrew Channel's init.d. The copy is what lets the daemon
# outlive an uninstall of the app and tidy up after it: the link and this file are
# removed as soon as the app is found to be gone (see launcher_gone below).
# Environment (all optional; the overrides exist for tests):
#   KEEPALIVE_NO_LAUNCH=1  do not start the app (the service sets it when it starts
#                          the daemon itself, so only a real TV start does)
#   GONE_WAIT=<seconds>    pause before the "app is gone" verdict is confirmed
#   KEEPALIVE_PERIOD=<s>   seconds between two keepalive calls (30)
